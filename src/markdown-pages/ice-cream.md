### What is Corporate Responsibility?

Simply speaking the notion refers to an inner discipline and understanding that meets performance goals. This includes both personal conduct, moral integrity and cooperation thereto.

Never before have we been more connected, engaged and in touch with global issues ranging from the refugee crisis, poverty, war, depleting natural resources, global warming, the distribution of wealth and the need for better solutions to health and mental wellbeing.

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), put simply, addresses the ethics of an organisation’s activities and how it operates in a way that is viable over the long term.  It is probably better described as business sustainability. As we are sure you know, it touches on the way your organisation impacts on society, the economy and the environment and yet is still not high up on the agenda for many organisations (particularly SMEs) in NI. This may prove to be a costly mistake. A lesson learned recently by some big hitters such as Volkswagen, Audi and Tesco to name a few.

CSR activity is not to be mistaken as an interest for hippies, tree huggers or overzealous  HR practitioners, but is a highly commercial and sound strategic approach, which impacts on long term business success.  HR has an extremely important role to play in helping to establish and maintain a CSR strategy, which in many organisations will still be considered a ‘nice thing to think about’ rather than a modern necessity for long term sustainability. 

In this month’s HR Insights we discuss the compelling numbers supporting a focus on CSR and the role HR have in it. 

CSR initiatives generally fall into four main groups. HR strategy is intrinsically linked to all of these.

Employees – focusing on the rights and well-being of employees and other workers in the value chain (including suppliers).
Environment – ethical resource and energy use, recycling, carbon footprint.
Community – how the organisation’s activities affect the community / public.
Market place – ethical sourcing, fair trading, corporate taxes and anti-bribery.
